# Yoshi-Game
2D game created with in C++ using SDL 

Strong examples of OOP concepts like inheritance and composition, efficiciency measures, and overall experimentation and creativity.

Known issues:
The game is, unfortunately unfinished. I accidetally unzipped an earlier version of the game into my working directoy, overwriting
all of the work to include a boss fight and a way for Yoshi to stick his tongue out, grab a bomb, and then fire it at the boss.
It is functional though, fortunately, but requires a machine capable of running SDL.
